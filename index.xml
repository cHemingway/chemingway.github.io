      <title>Using watchdog with LEDs on OrangePi Zero</title>

      <description>I have a small OrangePi zero on my home network turn on my desktop PC using Wake-on-Lan to SSH in and grab files/run processing when I am out and about. I use zerotier so I can SSH into both the orangepi and my desktop without needing Dynamic DNS or opening ports in my router.
However, the SD card used is a bit unreliable, and so occasionally the device will lock up.</description>

      <title>Converting Folder of WAV Files to FLAC</title>

      <description>For audio research, speech and noise corpus&amp;rsquo;s are commonly stored in uncompressed format, generally WAV. This results in very large file sizes, for instance the CSTR VCTK Corpus is 10GB.
However, common compression formats like MP3 or Ogg Vorbis would cause distortion of noise signals rendering them useless for comparision against results obtained from the original files.
Conversion As an exercise, I wrote this script to convert these all into the lossless FLAC format, using FFmpeg and GNU Parallel.</description>
