      <description>For audio research, speech and noise corpus&amp;rsquo;s are commonly stored in uncompressed format, generally WAV. This results in very large file sizes, for instance the CSTR VCTK Corpus is 10GB.
However, common formats like MP3 or Ogg Vorbis would cause distortion of noise signals rendering them usless, as they are designed for human speech/music.
Conversion As an exercise, I wrote this script to convert these all into the lossless FLAC format, using FFmpeg and GNU Parallel.</description>
